# CSCI-220-AVL-Tree-Project
Final project for my Data Structures And Algorithms class. 
Reads in a file and then constructs an AVL Tree out of it
AVL keeps track of a county code, population, and the name of the county.
User is then able to search for records, insert records, delete records, and list all records
