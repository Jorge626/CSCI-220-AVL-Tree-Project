# CSCI-220-Data-Structures-1
This repository stores a few of my projects from my class CSCI 220 - Data Structures 1.
I took this course at Mt. San Antonio College

There are 3 Projects in this repository. 

One project utilizes an AVL Tree data structure to keep track of a country code, population, and the name of the county. Users are able to search for records, insert records, delete records, and list the records.

Another project utilizes a Stack data structure to create a calcultor that stores an expression in postfix notation and solves the expression.

The last project utilizes a Node List data structure to create a text editor.
